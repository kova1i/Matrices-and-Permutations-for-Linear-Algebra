**Matrix Operations with SymPy**

This Python project leverages the `sympy` library to perform various matrix operations, including matrix multiplication, inversion, and transformation to reduced row-echelon form (RREF). The code provides a set of classes and functions for working with matrices and permutations.

**Key Features:**
- **Matrix Class:** A versatile `Matrix` class is implemented, supporting basic operations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, and exponentiation.
  
- **Permutation Class:** The `Permutation` class is designed for handling permutation operations, calculating their sign, finding inverses, and more.

- **Matrix Operations:** The code allows you to calculate the determinant of a matrix, find its trace, and determine its inverse if it exists.

- **Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF):** The `step_view` function facilitates the transformation of a matrix to its RREF, providing both the resulting matrix and a step-by-step breakdown of the operations performed.

- **Random Matrix Generation:** The project includes functions to generate random matrices, promoting flexibility and ease of testing.

**Usage:**
```python
# Example Usage
from sympy import Symbol
a = Symbol('a')
b = Symbol('b')

# Create a random matrix
mat_a = make_matrix(3, 3)

# Perform operations on matrices
result_matrix, steps = mat_a.step_view()
```

**Requirements:**
- `sympy`
